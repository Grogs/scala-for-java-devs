    There's no guidance for this one. You decide how to implement and test Conway's Game of Life.

    There are four rules for the game (from https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#/Rules):
      1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under population.
      2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
      3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
      4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

    Please follow Test Driven Development. Try to test and implement one rule before moving onto others (especially rule 4!).

    I suggest pairing for this Kata.
    Maybe try ping pong pairing?
