### Welcome to
## Scala for Java Developers
~
## Introductions

- Who are you?
- What do you do here at Expedia?
- What are you hoping to get from this session?
~
First, some setup...

```shell
brew install sbt
git clone https://github.com/Grogs/scala-for-java-devs.git
cd scala-for-java-devs
sbt compile
```
~~~~
What is Scala?
~
Object Oriented meets Functional, on the JVM.
~~~~
## Why use Scala?

Note:
Some motivation... Why bother with Scala?
~
### Better Java

Note:
* When I started using Scala at work 6 years ago, it was mainly interesting as a "better Java".
* For two reasons I think: it is more concise that Java, and the FP influences were seen as better.
* The Java community had already been embracing immutability (but awkwardly), and Java 8 brought in the streams API on collections.
* e.g. Guava had/has things like `List.transform` which mapped over collections
* Scala provides a nicer syntax for that, and the language encourages you to be immutable. (Collections are immutable by default, as are "case classes")
* But if I'm honest, Kotlin is very strong competition now IF you just want a "better Java". You get case classes, nice collection API etc.
~
### Performance / Scalability; yet with a concise syntax.

Note:
* This is one of the big motivations/reasons for myself and my team here at HCOM. 
* This could be a course on its own.
* For people from a Python/Ruby background Scala can just be a concise syntax with Java's performance.
* There's a bunch of libraries and whole ecosystems for concurrency and asynchronous programming now in Scala.
* Powerful Futures which I would argue are much nicer to work with than Java's CompletableFuture. Alternate implementations of Futures, and there are other things kind of like Futures but different.
* Such as Akka Actors which implement Erlang Actor model on the JVM.
* Stream processing libraries like akka-streams, monix, fs2. For Java you've got RxJava, and the Java 9 Flow API... In my opinion RxJava is not pleasant to work with compared with Scala alternatives.
~
### Datascience and Machine Learning ecosystem

Note:
* Spark is a big player here.
* The JVM seems to dominate in the big data world. I think as data science and ML have started happening on big data, you have datascientists with Python or R background, and they appreciate a more concise yet still performant syntax over Java.
* Also Functional programming is useful/imperative once you start doing distributed processing etc. MapReduce is basically just the concept of Monoid from Category Theory/Functional Programming.
~
### Static functional programming 

Note:
* Concurrent and asychronous programming are both a bit of a nightmare if you don't at least embrace immutability. 
* But FP in Scala can be a lot more than that!
* There are a number of library that implement or incorporate concepts from Category Theory. (Which basically just aims to make your code easier to reason about and compose.)
* In Scala we can do a lot with types. If you adopt the functional stuff in the Scala ecosystem, you can really have a lot more guarantees about your code at compile time.

### Hello world!

```scala
object Main extends App {
    println("Hello world!")
}
```

Note: 
- This is how you can write Hello world in Scala.
- It's immediately quite different from Java...
- What's `object`, what's `App`, where's my `main` method?
- Why not `System.out.println`
- No semicolon
~
### Long version of Hello world
```scala
object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Hello world!")
  }
}
```

Note:
- The `App` trait was just implementing main for you, but you can do it without App.
- Scala doesn't have static methods, instead you can put functions/methods on an object. `object` is a singleton, so the `main` method is equivalent to a static method.
- Methods start with `def`, the type (e.g. `Array[String]`) goes after the identifier. (instead of before)
- Return type is optional, as Scala can infer it for you. There is always a return value, instead of void methods, you return Unit.
- Type parameters use square brackets `[]` instead of angle brackets `<>`
~
Functions are expressions: No need for an explicit return statement

~
Conditionals are expressions

<iframe height="400px" frameborder="0" style="width: 100%" src="https://embed.scalafiddle.io/embed?sfid=uNllDP6/0"></iframe>
~
val/var to define variables

<iframe height="400px" frameborder="0" style="width: 100%" src="https://embed.scalafiddle.io/embed?sfid=uNllDP6/0"></iframe>

Note:
- val is like a `final` variable in Java.
- No need to specify the type when defining a variable
~
Method definition

```
<scope> def <functionName>(<parameterName: ParameterType>*): <returnType> = {
	body 
}
```
~~~~
# Object Oriented in Scala
~
Everything is an object 

<iframe height="400px" frameborder="0" style="width: 100%" src="https://embed.scalafiddle.io/embed?sfid=Gpjp4yj/0"></iframe>

Note:
- Even operators are methods. `+` is just a method on `Int`.
- In this way, primitives like Int can be an object. 
- In Java sometimes you have to think about boxing between `long` and `Long`; not so in Scala.
~
Even functions are objects

<iframe height="400px" frameborder="0" style="width: 100%" src="https://embed.scalafiddle.io/embed?sfid=20Q9653/0"></iframe>
~
Functional vs imperative
<iframe height="400px" frameborder="0" style="width: 100%" src="https://embed.scalafiddle.io/embed?sfid=mvcOonN/0&layout=h85"></iframe>

Note:
- Of course, this is a favourable example. 
- If you're familiar with Java 8 Streams you're probably comfortable with this functional style now.
- It's often more concise. 
- Especially in Scala (where the collections API is more concise than Java streams)
~~~~
Code Kata

Note:
- That was a quick whirlwind tour of Scala. But it should be enough for you to complete a Code Kata or two.
- Who has done a code kata before?
~
Deliberate practice to hone your Scala skills

Note:
- Often you do a code kata with a specific focus.
- e.g. you might do it in your language of choice, but focus on practicing TDD or pair programming.
- Right now we're focusing on getting familiar with syntax Scala.
~
We will due a few Katas today.
~
Let's start with FizzBuzz

Note:
Is everyone familiar with FizzBuzz?
~
__go fourth and practice__

- Open the project you checked out in IntelliJ.
- Go to FizzBuzzSpec and uncomment the tests
- Implement FizzBuzz!
