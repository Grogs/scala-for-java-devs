# Scala for Java developers

The plan of this course is getting started with Scala for developers who mainly work with Java. 

Before starting to check the code, it is recommendable to read some useful commands of [SBT.](https://github.com/soniarodriguez/scala-for-java-devs/tree/lesson1-java/sbt-getting-started.md)

Then, let's check some differences in a HelloWorld app in [Java](https://github.com/soniarodriguez/scala-for-java-devs/blob/master/src/main/java/AppJavaRunner.java)
vs [Scala](https://github.com/soniarodriguez/scala-for-java-devs/blob/master/src/main/scala/AppScalaRunner.scala).


## Lesson 1. Getting Started with Scala and SBT

In this lesson, you will familiarize with SBT and Scala. In the code, there are two Java interfaces:
`FileReader` and `PrincingService`, they have been implemented in Java. Check what they do, then, try to
 fix the failing tests by implementing in Scala the non-implemented methods.

*Note: Non-implemented methods are represented with `???`.
