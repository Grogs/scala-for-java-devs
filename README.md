# Scala for Java developers

The plan of this course is getting started with Scala for developers who mainly work with Java. 

Before starting to check the code, it is recommendable to read some useful commands of [SBT.](https://github.com/soniarodriguez/scala-for-java-devs/tree/lesson1-java/sbt-getting-started.md)

Then, let's check some differences in a HelloWorld app in [Java](https://github.com/soniarodriguez/scala-for-java-devs/blob/master/src/main/java/AppJavaRunner.java)
vs [Scala](https://github.com/soniarodriguez/scala-for-java-devs/blob/master/src/main/scala/AppScalaRunner.scala).
