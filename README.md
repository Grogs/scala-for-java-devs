# Lesson 8 - Code Kata

There are three code katas to choose from:

1. Fizz Buzz (Easy)
    - https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fizz_buzz
    - Uncomment the test cases in `FizzBuzzSpec`, create an object called `FizzBuzz` with a method `getResult`, and implement it, using the tests ot guide you.
2. Berlin Clock (Medium) 
    - https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mengenlehreuhr
    - Uncomment the test cases in `BerlinClockSpec`, create an object called `BerlinClock` and implement it, using the tests ot guide you.
3. Conway's Game of Life (Hard)
    - https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life 
    - No test cases given. You get to figure out how to test it!
    - I recommend you pair with another student for this Kata. 
        - If you pair, I would recommend "ping pong pairing": http://wiki.c2.com/?PairProgrammingPingPongPattern
