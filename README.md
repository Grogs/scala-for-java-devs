# Scala for Java developers
## Lesson 1. Getting Started with Scala and SBT

The plan for this lesson is to familiarize with SBT and Scala by creating some Scala classes from their Java implementations.

Before starting to check the code, it is recommendable to read some useful commands of [SBT.](https://github.com/soniarodriguez/scala-for-java-devs/tree/lesson1-java/sbt-getting-started.md)

Then, try to fix the tests failing in `JavaPricingServiceSpec` and `HotelFileReaderSpec` by implementing the not implemented methods in the `src/scala/hotels/service` directory.
